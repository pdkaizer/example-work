          <h3>Creative Brief & Strategy:</h3>
          
          <p>Here are 2 documents that I feel are good examples of strategic writing. Both are sections of larger documents the Marketing and Communications leadership group - of which I was a member - produced for the new CEO of CRS.</p> 

          <p>The first is a strategic assessment of the opportunities for marketing and communications for CRS. I am attaching the Web/Multimedia section which I authored.</p>

          <p>As a follow up to the first document the CEO asked the marketing team to produce essentially a creative brief focused on what A-level work would look like for CRS. It's important to note that the new CEO of CRS came from a lifetime in academia. She was the Dean of the Mendoza College of Business at The University of Notre Dame. I am attaching the section focusing on digital which again I authored.</p>
