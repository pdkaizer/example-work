          <h3>Creative Brief & Strategy:</h3>
          
          <p>Here two are examples of strategic writing. Both are sections of larger documents that the Catholic Relief Services marketing and communications leadership group&mdash;of which I was a member&mdash;produced for the new CEO of CRS.</p> 

          <p>The first is a strategic assessment of the opportunities for marketing and communications for CRS. I wrote the Web/Multimedia section.</p>

          <p>As a follow up to the first document, the CEO asked the marketing team to produce what was essentially a creative brief focused on what A-level work would look like for CRS. On a side note, the CEO came to CRS from a lifetime in academia, so she tended to use grades to evaluate our work. I wrote the digital section.</p>
