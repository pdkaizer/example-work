          <h3>IA: Wireframes and Site Maps</h3>

          <h4>Children's Inn at NIH</h4>

          <p>The first sample is a project I am working on for the Children's Inn at NIH. For this project, I am the primary digital strategy consultant. I produced a site map based on the client's revised IA and have produced responsive html/css wireframes, which I am linking to below:<br />

          <h4>Catholic Relief Services</h4>

          <p>The first  of these samples is for a site my team developed for CRS' Advocacy unit. For this project, the team acted as the user experience consultant, but the site was designed and built by an outside agency. We developed the IA, site map and wireframes. The final live site can be seen at: <a href="http://www.confrontglobalpoverty.org/">http://www.confrontglobalpoverty.org/</a></p>

          <p>The second sample is a site we built for CRS' fundraising team for a community fundraising and meal-packing program. We created the the entire site for this project, including IA, site design and custom Wordpress theme development. The final live site can be seen at: <a href="http://helpinghands.crs.org">http://helpinghands.crs.org</a>.</p>

          <h4>CRS.org</h4>

          <p>Like most very large organizations, CRS has multiple audiences with widely varying interests. One of the most significant challenges facing the web team was the need to address these audiences* using the main website as a point of entry to the agencyâ€™s work and its many specialized sites. Before I left CRS, we were beginning to plan out a strategy for overhauling a 6,000+ page website that had not been significantly revamped in more than seven years. Simply put, the goal was to create an architecture that would allow each audience segment to easily find the information they were looking for and engage with CRS. The site map to the right was our initial proposal for a redesigned homepage.</p>
