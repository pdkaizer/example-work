          <h4>Children's Inn at NIH</h4>

          <p>The first is a current freelance project I am working on for the Children's Inn at NIH. For this project I am the primary digital strategy consultant. I produced a site map based on their revised IA and have produced responsive html/css wireframes which I am linking to below:<br />

          <h4>Catholic Relief Services</h4>

          <p>The following 2 examples are work I oversaw that my team at CRS produced. I was not hands on involved in every aspect of the deliverables but oversaw and directed the work.</p>

          <p>The first is a site that we did for CRS' Advocacy team. They were looking to develop a new site for the Catholics Confront Global Poverty advocacy campaign that CRS does in conjunction with the USCCB. In the case of this project my team was the User Experience consultant but the site was designed and built by an outside agency. We did the IA, site map and wireframes for the project. The wireframes are to the right. The final live site can be seen at: <a href="http://www.confrontglobalpoverty.org/">http://www.confrontglobalpoverty.org/</a></p>

          <p>The second is a site we did for CRS' fund-raising team. This site was for the CRS Helping Hands program which is a community fund-raising and meal packing program where Parish's or Schools can hold a meal packing event. We did the the entire site for this project, IA, site design and custom Wordpress theme development and programing. The IA is to the far right. The final live site can be seen at: <a href="http://helpinghands.crs.org">http://helpinghands.crs.org</a>.</p>
